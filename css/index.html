            Following the success of the Fantastic Four in 1961 and the subsequent revival of superhero comic books, Marvel set about creating new superhero characters.[1] During this time, Stan Lee developed the initial concept for Iron Man.[1] Lee was interested
            in making an unlikeable character likeable, saying that he "thought it would be fun to take the kind of character that nobody would like, none of [Marvel's] readers would like, and shove him down their throats and make them like him".[2] Iron
